## By Pass Agent Based Validations!

- Get the cluster_id and make note of it as the cluster_id is needed in subsequent API calls:


$ curl -s -S http://<RENDEZVOUS_IP>:8090/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters | jq . | grep cluster_id


- optionally, query the API to see any validations that failed on that host. Increment the .hosts[0] to iterate over each host if desired:


$ curl -s -S http://<RENDEZVOUS_IP>:8090/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/{cluster_id} | jq .hosts[0].validations_info


- list the currently ignored validations (by default it should be empty with no validations ignored):


$ curl -s -S http://<RENDEZVOUS_IP>:8090/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/{cluster_id}/ignored-validations

- apply the validation that should be disabled; in this case we'll try ignoring all validations:


$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"host-validation-ids": "[\"all\"]"}' -s -S http://<RENDEZVOUS_IP>:8090/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/{cluster_id}/ignored-validations
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cluster-validation-ids": "[\"all\"]"}' -s -S http://<RENDEZVOUS_IP>:8090/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/{cluster_id}/ignored-validations


- Repeat step #3 to confirm that particular validations are now ignored:


$ curl -s -S http://<RENDEZVOUS_IP>:8090/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/{cluster_id}/ignored-validations

{cluster_id} in the above commands is the Cluster ID gathered during step#1
